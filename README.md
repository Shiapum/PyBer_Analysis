# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview

### Purpose
- Create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
- Create a  plot that shows the total weekly faares for each city type. 
- And submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 

### Background
PyBer is a python based ride sharing app. An analyisis is required to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserve neighborhoods.

## Resources
- Data source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook
- Data output: PyBer_fare_summary.png

## Analysis
The following analysis was made with data from January 1st, 2019 to May 8th, 2019. 

The cities where PyBer is working, are categorized as follows:
- Rural
- Suburban
- Urban

The data was summarized followig the cities categories. From the next table, we can notice:
- The fares on urban cities are the 62.7% of the total. 
- The fares on suburban cities are the 30.5 of the total.
- The fares on rural cities are the 6.8% of the total. 
- The number of rides in the urban cities is less than the number of available drivers. This means that some drivers are not getting a ride. 
- The average fare in urban cities is the lowest, so the drivers from urban cities are earning the lowest out of the three.
- The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver in the rural area are the highest. Customers probably are traveling longer distances in rural areas.

Even with the fares in the urban cities are the lowest, if we plot the fares by city type by week, we can see that the urban cities rides are where most accumulated fare is earned.

## Summary
From this information we can suggest the following:
- Encourage urban drivers to move to suburban or rural cities because they can earn more due the fares are higher. 
- Analyze why there is not a big demand on rural cities and try to improve the number of rides.
- Add promotions to the fare in rural cities so more users wants to use the app.
